🎫 Create a simple NFT:

👷‍♀️ You'll compile and deploy your first smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! 🚀

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase and transfer NFTs. Deploy your contracts to a testnet, then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

💬 Meet other builders working on this challenge and get help in the [Challenge 0 Telegram](https://t.me/+Y2vqXZZ_pEFhMGMx)!

## Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛

> ⛽️ You'll need to get some funds from the faucet for gas.

![gas&wallet](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/912d0d4b-db34-49d3-bd7d-7ca0ab18eb66)

> 🦊 At first, **don't** connect MetaMask. If you are already connected, click **Disconnect**:

</p>

> 🔥 We'll use burner wallets on localhost.

> 👛 Explore how burner wallets work in 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 by opening a new incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You'll notice it has a new wallet address in the top right. Copy the incognito browser's address and send localhost test funds to it from your first browser (using the **Faucet** button in the bottom left):

![icognito&webBrowser](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/fd191447-a31f-4c03-a36f-936bfb70c2a1)

> 👨🏻‍🚒 When you close the incognito window, the account is gone forever. Burner wallets are great for local development but you'll move to more permanent wallets when you interact with public networks.

---

## Checkpoint 2: 🖨 Minting

> ✏️ Mint some NFTs! Click the **MINT NFT** button in the `My NFTs` tab.

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/74cf02f2-4c1b-4278-9841-f19f668e0b1e)

👀 You should see your NFTs start to show up:

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/63dabceb-ad42-4c09-8e5d-a0139939e32d)

👛 Open an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000

🎟 Transfer an NFT to the incognito window address using the UI:

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/3b92fb50-d43f-48a8-838c-c45c443b0b71)

👛 Try to mint an NFT from the incognito window.

> Can you mint an NFT with no funds in this address? You might need to grab funds from the faucet to pay for the gas!

🕵🏻‍♂️ Inspect the `Debug Contracts` tab to figure out what address is the owner of YourCollectible?

🔏 You can also check out your smart contract `YourCollectible.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`.

💼 Take a quick look at your deploy script `00_deploy_your_contract.js` in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.

📝 If you want to edit the frontend, navigate to `packages/nextjs/app` and open the specific page you want to modify. For instance: `/myNFTs/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.

## Checkpoint 3: 💾 Deploy your contract! 🛰

🛰 Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> Change the defaultNetwork in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia`.

![chall-0-hardhat-config](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/f94b47d8-aa51-46eb-9c9e-7536559a5d45)

🔐 Generate a deployer address with `yarn generate`. This creates a unique deployer address and saves the mnemonic locally.

> This local account will deploy your contracts, allowing you to avoid entering a personal private key.

![chall-0-yarn-generate](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/2486142/133f5701-e575-4cc2-904f-cdc83ae86d94)

👩‍🚀 Use `yarn account` to view your deployer account balances.

![chall-0-yarn-account](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/2486142/c34df8c9-9793-4a76-849b-170fae7fd0f0)

⛽️ You will need to send ETH to your deployer address with your wallet, or get it from a public faucet of your chosen network.

> Some popular faucets are [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and [https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia)

> ⚔️ Side Quest: Keep a 🧑‍🎤 [punkwallet.io](https://punkwallet.io) on your phone's home screen and keep it loaded with testnet eth. 🧙‍♂️ You'll look like a wizard when you can fund your deployer address from your phone in seconds.

🚀 Deploy your NFT smart contract with `yarn deploy`.

> 💬 Hint: You can set the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia` **OR** you can `yarn deploy --network sepolia`.

---

## Checkpoint 4: 🚢 Ship your frontend! 🚁

> ✏️ Edit your frontend config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` to change the `targetNetwork` to `chains.sepolia` :

![chall-0-scaffold-config](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/3b50c7a7-b9cc-4af3-ab2a-11be4f5d2235)

> You should see the correct network in the frontend (http://localhost:3000):

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/50eef1f7-e1a3-4b3b-87e2-59c19362c4ff)

> 🦊 Since we have deployed to a public testnet, you will now need to connect using a wallet you own or use a burner wallet. By default 🔥 `burner wallets` are only available on `hardhat` . You can enable them on every chain by setting `onlyLocalBurnerWallet: false` in your frontend config (`scaffold.config.ts` in `packages/nextjs/`)

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/f582d311-9b57-4503-8143-bac60346ea33)

> 💬 Hint: For faster loading of your transfer page, consider updating the `fromBlock` passed to `useScaffoldEventHistory` in [`packages/nextjs/app/transfers/page.tsx`](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/blob/challenge-0-simple-nft/packages/nextjs/app/transfers/page.tsx#L12) to `blocknumber - 10` at which your contract was deployed. Example: `fromBlock: 3750241n` (where `n` represents its a [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)). To find this blocknumber, search your contract's address on Etherscan and find the `Contract Creation` transaction line.

🚀 Deploy your NextJS App

```shell
yarn vercel
```

> Follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

> If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

⚠️ Run the automated testing function to make sure your app passes

```shell
yarn test
```

#### Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.  
This is great to complete your **SpeedRunEthereum**.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- 🔷`ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

- 📃`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` with your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> 💬 Hint: It's recommended to store env's for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.

---

## Checkpoint 5: 📜 Contract Verification

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running (`yarn verify --network network_name`) :

```shell
yarn verify --network sepolia
```

> It is okay if it says your contract is already verified. Copy the address of YourCollectable.sol and search it on sepolia Etherscan to find the correct URL you need to submit this challenge.

## Checkpoint 6: 💪 Flex!

👩‍❤️‍👨 Share your public url with a friend and ask them for their address to send them a collectible :)

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 Challenges

**Learn how to use 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 to create decentralized applications on Ethereum. 🚀**

---

## 🚩 Challenge 0: 🎟 Simple NFT Example

🎫 Create a simple NFT to learn the basics of 🏗 scaffold-eth. You'll use 👷‍♀️ HardHat to compile and deploy smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! 🚀

https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/challenge-0-simple-nft

---

## 🚩 Challenge 1: 🔏 Decentralized Staking App

🦸 A superpower of Ethereum is allowing you, the builder, to create a simple set of rules that an adversarial group of players can use to work together. In this challenge, you create a decentralized application where users can coordinate a group funding effort. If the users cooperate, the money is collected in a second smart contract. If they defect, the worst that can happen is everyone gets their money back. The users only have to trust the code.

https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/challenge-1-decentralized-staking

---

## 🚩 Challenge 2: 🏵 Token Vendor

🤖 Smart contracts are kind of like "always on" vending machines that anyone can access. Let's make a decentralized, digital currency. Then, let's build an unstoppable vending machine that will buy and sell the currency. We'll learn about the "approve" pattern for ERC20s and how contract to contract interactions work.

https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/challenge-2-token-vendor

---

## 🚩 Challenge 3: 🎲 Dice Game

🎰 Randomness is tricky on a public deterministic blockchain. In this challenge you will explore creating random numbers using block hash and how that may be exploitable. Attack the dice game with your own contract by predicting the randomness ahead of time to always roll a winner!

https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/challenge-3-dice-game

---

## 🚩 Challenge 4: ⚖️ Build a DEX Challenge

💵 Build an exchange that swaps ETH to tokens and tokens to ETH. 💰 This is possible because the smart contract holds reserves of both assets and has a price function based on the ratio of the reserves. Liquidity providers are issued a token that represents their share of the reserves and fees...

DEX Telegram Channel: https://t.me/+_NeUIJ664Tc1MzIx

## 🎉 Checkpoint: Eligible to join 🏰️ BuidlGuidl

The BuidlGuidl is a curated group of Ethereum builders creating products, prototypes, and tutorials to enrich the web3 ecosystem. A place to show off your builds and meet other builders. Start crafting your Web3 portfolio by submitting your DEX, Multisig or SVG NFT build.

---

## 🚩 Challenge 5: 📺 State Channel Application Challenge

🛣️ The Ethereum blockchain has great decentralization & security properties but these properties come at a price: transaction throughput is low, and transactions can be expensive. This makes many traditional web applications infeasible on a blockchain... or does it? State channels look to solve these problems by allowing participants to securely transact off-chain while keeping interaction with Ethereum Mainnet at a minimum.

## 💡 Contributing: Guide and Hints to create New Challenges

- We'd use the [base-challenge-template](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/base-challenge-template) as a starting point for each challenge.
- UI wise, we'll try to use the https://speedrunethereum.com/ design vibe.

Check out already migrated Challenges to get a better idea of the structure and how to create new ones.

A quick start guide.

### 1. Branch from [base-challenge-template](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/base-challenge-template)

At `base-challenge-template` branch we will be adding the latest updates from Scaffold ETH 2. We'll also include the learnings we acquire during the Challenges we are adding, as well as the code that may be common to all the Challenges.

### 2. Edit `pages/index.tsx`

The main page should have a banner image (ask for it!) + the Challenge description.

> {challengeHeroImage}
>
> A {challengeDescription}.
>
> 🌟 The final deliverable is an app that {challengeDeliverable}.
> Deploy your contracts to a testnet then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

### 3. Implement the Challenge

- Add the contract(s)
- Add pages / components as you need (UI following the [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com/) design vibe)
- Create the test for the Smart Contract(s). The best starting point is to copy the tests from the SE1 Challenge you are migrating. The "envvar" logic there is used by the autograder, so don't remove them.

### 4. Adapt Header / MetaHeader component

Update the site title on `Header.tsx` and title and description of your challenge in `MetaHeader.tsx`.

### 5. Image assets for your Challenge

You will need to add the following image assets in `packages/nextjs/public` folder (ask the designers for it):

- **Thumbnail.** `thumbnail.png`
  Will be shown in your link previews when shared to others in chat or in social media.
- **Hero image.** `hero.png`
  It's a wider version of the Thumbnail with SRE logo at the bottom right. Used as README header, and as `pages/index.tsx` hero image.

### 6. Edit README adapting the [base template](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/tree/base-challenge-template#readme)

Adapt the base template README using the SE-1 version as a reference.

### 7. Create a PR against the challenge branch

We can iterate and test there.
